# Execution Context

In programming, an execution context refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It consists of all the necessary information and resources needed to run the code. The concept of an execution context is crucial in understanding how code is executed and how variables and functions are stored and accessed during runtime.

## Components of Execution Context

An execution context can be thought of as a container that holds three main components:

1. **Variable Environment:** This component stores all the declared variables and functions within the current scope. It includes function arguments, local variables, and function declarations. Each execution context has its own variable environment.

2. **Scope Chain:** The scope chain is a list of variable environments that are accessible to the current execution context. It is used for identifier resolution when a variable or function is referenced. The scope chain is created based on the lexical scope (or static scope) of the code.

3. **This Value:** The "this" value refers to the object that is currently being operated on or the object that the function is bound to. It represents the context in which the current code is being executed.

## Execution Context Lifecycle

When code is executed, the execution context goes through two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.

1. **Creation Phase:** In this phase, the execution context is set up. The following steps occur during the creation phase:

   - **Creation of the Variable Object:** The variable object is created, and it contains all the variables, function declarations, and function arguments. It also allocates memory space for variables and functions.

   - **Creation of the Scope Chain:** The scope chain is created by linking the variable objects of the outer scopes. This forms a hierarchical chain of variable environments.

   - **Determining the Value of "this":** The value of "this" is determined based on how a function is invoked. It can refer to the global object (e.g., window object in a browser) or be explicitly set using function invocation patterns (e.g., as an object's method).

2. **Execution Phase:** In this phase, the code is executed line by line. The interpreter or compiler uses the execution context to find variables and functions. During the execution phase, the following steps take place:

   - **Assigning Values:** Variables are assigned values and functions are invoked.

   - **Scoping and Identifier Resolution:** When a variable or function is referenced, the interpreter searches the scope chain to find the corresponding identifier. It starts from the current execution context and traverses up the chain until the identifier is found or until the global scope is reached.

   - **Executing Code:** The code is executed in a sequential manner, following the order of statements.
